        I Javed Ahamad Khan Director and Mentor of V.K. Public School - Jogiyabari Maharajganj, leave message for all the students and parents.
        V.K. Public School, we aspire to provide top quality education to all students, with a well-balanced and relevant curriculum. Education is a passage to freedom from the shackles of ignorance.
        In todayâ€™s dynamic world, education is an asset. First, we all have to be on the same page: childrens, teachers and parents have to understand that education is not restricted to lessons taught in the classroom from text books.
        Parents and teachers must encourage children to ask as many questions as they can.

\n Here, at V.K. Public School, we strive to provide experiential learning. Schools and teachers must ensure that children have a society of enhancing experiences because imagination often thought to be more important than knowledge.
It is our promise to make them-not only successful human beings-but also good human beings.
